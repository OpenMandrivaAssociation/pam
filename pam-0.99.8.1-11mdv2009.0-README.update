PAM 0.99.8.1 update notes

- pam_unix dropped

The pam_unix module has been dropped in favour of the pam_tcb module and is
no longer available in the pam package from Mandriva.  The pam_tcb module will
work with the TCB shadowing scheme or regular shadow passwords.  It also provides
the ability to use blowfish passwords, rather than just md5 passwords.
